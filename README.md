A simple web application to exchange builds between different teams involved in the software development process.

Hierarchy of how builds are organized:

Product > Component > builds

Enhancements:
* User login system
* Support for teams(eg: Dev, Test, SE, etc...)
* Facility to change the status on the builds (new, testing, stable, unstable, production)
